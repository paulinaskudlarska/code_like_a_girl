<br/><br/><p>Krakow has one of the best nightlife's in Europe, it is said to have the highest density of bars in the world.
   A lot of bars and clubs are situated in old cellars and courtyards, e.g Kazimierz to Rynek Glowny and the Jewish quarters.
   People from all over the world come to visit Krakow especially students who are there in Krakow for the clubs and bars because of the cheap prices,
   you'd expect to pay around 5-15z for a pint which is around 1e-3.25e. Most clubs and bars are open all night as well which could be handy for people
   who want to experience the whole night out in Krakow. The main streets for clubbing is Florianska and Szewska, since them streets are fairly popular
   among the clubbing industry they could charge a little more of money for alcohol but it would be around 5-20z.
