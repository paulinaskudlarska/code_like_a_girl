  <li>The first picture in the top left corner shows a zapiekanka which is one of the most popular street foods
      in Krakow. It's half a baguette or a long piece of bread with white mushrooms and cheese, sometimes
      there's other toppings added, it all depends on the person, then toasted until cheese melts.</li>

  <li>The second picture in the top middle is an obwarzanek, it's sold in a tiny stand all over
      old town and market square, it's similar to a pretzel, it's a braided ring-shaped bread boiled and
      sprinkled with salt, poppy seeds or sesame seeds and sometimes cheese.</li>

  <li>The third picture in the top right corner is a picture of kielbasa which is a sausage that is put on a barbeque grill and grilled
      until the skin looks crispy and dark, the sausage is sliced into little diamonds to look more fancy, It's
      usually eaten with a round roll and some mustard.</li>

  <li>The fourth picture in bottom left corner is a picture of two osycpki which are a smoked cheese made out of sheep's milk
    it's not sold everywhere since its more popular in the South of Poland, it's eaten with cranberry sauce
    sometimes because it has a distinct taste that not everyone may like.</li>

  <li>The fifth picture in the centre bottom is a picture of pierogi which are basically dumplins with fillings such as meat, sauerkraut
      and mushrooms, potato and cream cheese or fruit.</li>


  <li>The sixth picture in the right bottom corner is a picture of Zurek which is a traditional polish soup which is mainly
      eaten at Easter but again it depends on the person it could be eaten any time of the year, Its made out of rye flour and meat, it has
      also has eggs and pieces of potato and white sausage.</li>
