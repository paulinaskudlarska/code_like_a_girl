      <li>The first picture is of the Wawel Castle which has a lot to it. It has a cathedral where the past polish president is buried
          it also has a museum in parts of the actual castle, it's a very beautiful stucture built in during the times of
          Reneissance, it was completed in 1540 by the brothers King Alexander and Sigismund 1 the Old.
          Wawel castles history is an urban legend whuch is that a mythical ruler called krakus vanished the wawel dragon in the 7th century.
          However historians disagree with this urban legend and say people did not settle in krakows old town till the 8th century because 966 was the first written record of the citys name.
        </li>

      <li> The second picture is of The main square in Krakow is one of the major urban space located in the center of the city.It is one of the largest medieval
           towns squares in Europe. The main square is surrounded by churches and historic townhouses. In the center of the actual square
           there is a cloth hall which is basically stalls with traditional polish clothing and souvenirs for tourists which is
           actually quite expensive to shop in. The market square was rebuilt in 1555 in the Reneissance style. Monuments like the Town hall tower
           , Adam Mickiewicz Tower or the Gothic towers of St Marys Basillica.
         </li>

        </li>

      <li> The fourth picture is of the St Marys Basillica,
           he con­struc­tion of St. Marys Basi­lli­ca was star­ted in late 13th cen­tu­ry on the foun­da­tions of a for­mer Roma­ne­sque church. The new tem­ple was con­se­cra­ted aro­und the year 1320.
           In late 19th cen­tu­ry, Tade­usz Stry­jenski headed exten­si­ve resto­ra­tion of the tem­ple. At that time, the church acqu­ired new pain­ted deco­ra­tions desi­gned by Jan Matej­ko and cre­ated by Sta­ni­slaw Wyspianski, Jozef Mehof­fer, and others. The vault imi­ta­tes a star-fil­led sky and the walls are cove­red by pain­tings with orna­men­tal and heral­dic the­mes, pray­ers to St. Mary, and ima­ges of angels play­ing instru­ments.

          <li>The sixth picture is of the entrance to Auschwitz in Oswiecim, Poland. People come to Krakow to travel to Oswiecim
              by a tour bus which takes an hour and a half and go for the tour. The tour includes going into a museum which was set in the Houses and Barracks,
              the tour includes seeing all the belongings that the people owned and sometimes the tour guides bring tourists into the gas chambers and to see the ovens.
              Most of the Birkenau camp was destroyed back in the 1900s so it would never be used as a concentration camp again.
